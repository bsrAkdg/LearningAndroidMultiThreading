** Instantiating New Threads : Two way
    1. Create a class : (Inheritance)
        public class MyThread extends Thread {
            private final int mSeed;

            public MyThread(int seed) {
                mSeed = seed;
            }

            @Override
            public void run() {
                // perform some calculation
            }
        }

        Thread myCustomThread = new MyThread(10);
        myCustomThread.start(); // start thread

    2. User runnable : (Composition) This is a container for threads

        Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                int seed = 10;
                // perform some calculation
            }
        }

        Thread thread = new Thread(runnable);
        thread.start(); // start thread
